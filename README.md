# weather app
Hi there,
thank you for coming here,
This project is a java-programmed web app wrapping a single-page mark-up file
comprising a combination of - html/css/js
The java architecture is essentially going to be an MVC design pattern 
No database is connected yet as all data are being accessed in real time from an open source api call.

The app essentially allows for a limited tracking of real time weather-data
While it is currently being upgraded to fix bugs and other things,
You can load this url to play around with it
